Make the following additions to the models/booking.test.js file:

 ✅ First add a new describe grouping inside the describe Booking grouping. It should describe Test createBooking.
 
 ✅ Inside the Test createBooking grouping, add two new test cases:
    Test Can create a new booking with valid params
        ✅ It should create a dummy user object containing only the username property equal to jlo
        Then it should select one of the listing ids from the testListingIds array. 
            Look at the values for that listing in the tests/createListings.js file.
        It should then use the Listing model to fetch that listing.
        Next, it should create a newBooking object with startDate, endDate, and guests properties
        Then it should use the createBooking method on the Booking model to create a new booking using the newBooking object
            , listing, and user.
        Finally, it should check that the booking returned by that method is equal to an expected booking, 
            containing the
            properties: id, startDate, endDate, paymentMethod, guests, listingId, username, userId, and 
                createdAt. 
            Use exact values or expect.any matchers when necessary.
